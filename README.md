Semester Task 2018/19 - Control of Two Reflectors

Task: Create the program for MZAPO board that controls two RGB reflectors. 

Functionalities of the MZAPO board:

LED Select:
1. Left reflector
2. Right reflector
3. Two reflectors

LED Effect:
1. static light
a. individually - only the selected reflector is set and the other is not changed.
b. both - they change simultaneously.
c. copy - the reflector takes the setting from the other
2. continuous color change
a. individually - for a single spotlight.
b. common - for both, or for both in anti-phase.
3. flashing
a. individually - the flashing is only set for the selected reflector and the other is
not changed.
b. together - set at the same time for both reflectors.
c. phase offset - with one reflector, the phase of the set flashing can be shifted.

Size change:
1. The implementation of a double magnified font, so that even people with poor
eyesight can read it well.

Ethernet:
1. The implementation of UDP protocol to control another unit.
